# Colonization Mobile Game

## About :information_source:

This is a pet project that I wanted to do to learn more about making games in Unity for mobile platforms, specifically Android.

Initially, I was thinking that I will publish this game on Google Play and keep the repo private, but with time I came to a conclusion that it's not worth it. It turned out to be quite big project for me and in order to finish it I need more motivation, and since I am not doing any devlogs to share my progress, I think making the repo public can help me. Even if no one will ever look inside this repo, knowing that it is publicly available to everyone helps me perform better. Right now I have only one goal regarding this project - just finish it. I am not intended to earn any profits with it.

Hope you will find something useful in here! :purple_heart:

## If you want to use my assets or code :memo:

- The code and assets in this project are, for the most part, done by me and they might not be perfect. Some parts of my code is specifically designed for this project and you going to have to adapt it for your case. I'm thinking about extracting some code, generalizing it, maybe adding some features and realising it as a separate repository named smth like "Unity Utilities". Some modules can be converted to a full blown tool, for example that's how my tool, [Icons Creator](https://github.com/xyperine/Icons-Creator) was born - it originated as a small 100 lines MonoBehaviour component in this project.
- Some assets and code depend on [Shapes](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/particles-effects/shapes-173167), and you will run into problems using those assets, because Shapes Scripts and Shaders folders are not included in the repository since Shapes license prohibits exposing Shapes code. If you have Shapes - you can simply [import](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-import.html) Scripts and Shaders folders.
- There is no documentation for the code in the project :flushed::point_right::point_left:. You can [email](mailto:ewsannne@gmail.com) me if you **really** need help and you can't figure it out on your own. I will make a reasonable effort to respond to such requests in a timely manner, and provide help to the best of my ability. However, I do not guarantee any specific results or outcomes from my services.
- And please, don't forget to include my license in your projects
