# Colonization Mobile Game

## About :information_source:

This is a pet project that I wanted to do to learn more about making games in Unity for mobile platforms, specifically Android.

You are a robot sent to a distant planet to build some infrastructure for future colonists. Main mechanic and some other features are based on a game called [Moon Pioneer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.norwichsidegames.tothemoon).

Since it is a work in progress, it lacks some key features and is not really playable at the moment. You can kind of "finish" the game by building a main hub in the center of the map - that's considered the end of the game. If you want to download the entire project and play with it - please, read a point about Shapes in [Using my assets/entire project :memo:](#using-my-assetsentire-project-memo) section.

I made the repository public because I got tired of making it in private and I want to expose and share the game's insides.

Hope you will find something useful in here! :purple_heart:

## Using my assets/entire project :memo:

- The code and assets in this project are, for the most part, done by me, except for those:
    * Everything in Plugins folder (except for Icons Creator)
    * Rocks and Stalagmites models
    * Water Shader  
- Some assets and code depend on [Shapes](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/particles-effects/shapes-173167), and you will run into problems using those assets, because Shapes Scripts and Shaders folders are not included in the repository since Shapes license prohibits exposing its code. If you have Shapes, you can simply [import](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-import.html) missing Scripts and Shaders folders.
- Please don't forget to include my license in your projects.
