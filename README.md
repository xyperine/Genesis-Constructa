## About :information_source:

This is a pet project that I wanted to do to learn more about making games in Unity for mobile platforms, specifically Android.

Initially, I was thinking that I will publish this game on Google Play and keep the repo private, but with time I came to a conclusion that it's not worth it. It turned out to be quite big project for me and in order to finish it I need more motivation, and since I am not doing any devlogs to share my progress, I think making the repo public can help me. Even if no one will ever look inside this repo, knowing that it is publicly available to everyone helps me perform better.

Right now I have only one goal regarding this project - just finish it. I am not intended to earn any profits with it.

The code and assets in this project are, for the most part, done by me and they might not be perfect. 

Hope you will find something useful or at least interesting! :purple_heart:

## Notes

- Some assets and code depend on [Shapes](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/particles-effects/shapes-173167), and if you want to use them, you will run into problems, because Shapes Scripts and Shaders folders are not included in the repository since Shapes license prohibits exposing Shapes code. If you have Shapes - you can simply [import](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-import.html) Scripts and Shaders folders.
- There is no documentation for the code in the project :flushed::point_right::point_left:. You can contact me [here] if you **really** need help and you can't figure it out on your own. I will make a reasonable effort to respond to such requests in a timely manner, and provide help to the best of my ability. However, I do not guarantee any specific results or outcomes from my services.
