# Colonization Mobile Game

## About :information_source:

This is a pet project that I wanted to do to learn more about making games in Unity for mobile platforms, specifically Android.

You are playing as a robot, you were sent to a distant planet to build some infrastructure for future colonists. Main mechanic and some other features are based on a game called [Moon Pioneer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.norwichsidegames.tothemoon).

Since it is a work in progress, it is not really playable at the moment. It lacks some models, features, effects, audio, etc. You can kind of "finish" the game by building a main hub in the center of the map - that's considered the end of the game. If you want to download the entire project and play it - please, read a point about Shapes in [Using my assets/entire project :memo:](#using-my-assetsentire-project-memo) section. However, I made the repository public not for people to play the game, but because I got bored of making it in private and I want to expose and share game's insides, so maybe you will be interested in looking at them.

Hope you will find something useful in here! :purple_heart:

## Using my assets/entire project :memo:

- The code and assets in this project are, for the most part, done by me, except for those:
    * Everything in Plugins folder (except for Icons Creator)
    * Rocks and Stalagmites models
    * Water Shader  
- Some assets and code depend on [Shapes](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/particles-effects/shapes-173167), and you will run into problems using those assets, because Shapes Scripts and Shaders folders are not included in the repository since Shapes license prohibits exposing its code. If you have Shapes, you can simply [import](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-import.html) missing Scripts and Shaders folders.
- There is no documentation for the code :flushed::point_right::point_left: You can [email](mailto:ewsannne@gmail.com) me if you **really** need help and you can't figure it out on your own. I will make a reasonable effort to respond to such requests in a timely manner, and provide help to the best of my ability. However, I do not guarantee any specific results or outcomes from my services.
- And please, don't forget to include my license in your projects.

## Support me :gift_heart:

Thank you! :blush:
